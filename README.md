# ToDoMK-v2 APP


#### Simply ToDo app made with Javascript.
In this project I was getting familiar with ExpressJS and practiced separating Front-End from Back-End.

Because of CORS policy, app in order to work in your browser needs a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?hl=en-US"> Moesif Origin & CORS Changer <a> extension to be installed.
